Insurance Risk and ICP Forecasting
This project focuses on developing predictive models for insurance risk assessment and Intracluster Pricing (ICP) forecasting. The models leverage advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions and insightful analysis.

Overview
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Assess insurance risks based on historical data.
Forecast Intracluster Pricing (ICP) trends.
Features
Risk Assessment: Utilizes various features from the dataset to predict the likelihood of different insurance risks.
ICP Forecasting: Implements time series analysis and machine learning techniques, including the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to predict future ICP trends.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the predictive models.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is privately acquired and contains sensitive information. Due to confidentiality agreements, it cannot be shared publicly. If you have access to similar datasets, you can use this codebase to build and test your own models.

Note: The project notebooks may display a few rows of this sensitive data for demonstration purposes.
